Cyber Dump

Calvin McClure, Leevon Casey, Rogelio Garcia, Keyan Ngai

The purpose of our project is to sell computer hardware found at the dump. The reservation system is in place to allow customers to reserve parts before we find them.

We created a website by utilizing Source Tree to each work on different parts of the website at the same time.

I would like you not to focus on the attractiveness of the products or the accuracy of our prices, instead try to understand the potential of the ability to request parts from landfills and dumps everywhere! We created a form that allows us to keep in contact and help people find specific items for them. The rest of the website is just for an example of a possible application for it.
